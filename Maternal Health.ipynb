    "- **Deaths/100000**: The maternal mortality rate per 100,000 live births in the state for the given year.\n",
    "- **Multivitamin use ≥4 times a week during the month before pregnancy - Unweighted Sample Size**: The number of survey respondents.\n",
    "- **Multivitamin use ≥4 times a week during the month before pregnancy - Unweighted Frequency**: The raw count of respondents who reported using multivitamins more than four times a week.\n",
    "- **Multivitamin use ≥4 times a week during the month before pregnancy - Weighted %**: The percentage of respondents, adjusted for the population, who used multivitamins as described.\n",
    "- **Multivitamin use ≥4 times a week during the month before pregnancy - Lower 95% Confidence Interval**: The lower bound of the 95% confidence interval for the percentage.\n",
    "- **Multivitamin use ≥4 times a week during the month before pregnancy - Upper 95% Confidence Interval**: The upper bound of the 95% confidence interval for the percentage.\n",
